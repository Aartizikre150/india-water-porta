In this project proposal, I outline my plan for conducting a marketing analysis focused on the "India Water Portal." Water insecurity is a critical global issue, particularly in developing countries like India, where access to safe drinking water remains a challenge.

This project aims to address the fragmented water management and policy issues in India and provide insights into water usage, availability, and quality. I will analyze various datasets related to water resources in India to derive meaningful marketing insights.

The platform aims to achieve several goals, including raising widespread awareness about the significant and pressing water challenges faced in India and drawing policymaker attention to emerging water-related trends.

Our intended audience encompasses the general public, young individuals aspiring to pursue careers in civil services and policy roles, government officials involved in water-related matters, philanthropic individuals or  organizations, as well as active participants in civil society initiatives.
